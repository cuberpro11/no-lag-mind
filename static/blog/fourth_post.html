<p>Besides the insane amount of skill and practice that it takes to be able to type that fast, which keyboard you have could effect how fast you can type a lot. This is why all the top typists carefully pick, mod, and use every keyboard that they get.</p>
<p>Every mechanical keyboard has three main comments that effect the typing experience: switches, keycaps, and layout.</p>
<h5>Switches</h5>
<p>For the longest time I have beed using linear switches to type, thinking that the less there is between my finger and the actuation, the better. However, it is the exact opposite. This is because on a linear switch the satisfying click sound comes after the key was already bottomed out and the letter has been printed to the screen. This means that I have to bottom out every keypress to ensure that every keypress is registered.</p>
<p>On the other hand, clicky or tactile switches make the click sound and feel at the same time as the letter is being printed to the screen. This means you instinctively let go of the key and move on to the next one without ever bottoming the switch. Which leads to faster times and less hand fatigue, when typing for longer periods.</p>
<p>Not only does the audible and physical feedback of the non-linear switches improve typing speed, but it also can improve your accuracy. This is because:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no increase of resistance before the key is registered, causing accidental keypresses when brushing over or resting your finger on a key.</li>
<li>Because there is no consistent feedback when a key is registered (only when bottoming out) this can cause you to hesitate or lose your flow of typing, which also leads to more t.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Keycaps</h5>
<p>All of the fastest typists use standard OEM or Cherry keycaps, which are sculpted and concave. This helps them feel where each key ends and starts, helping improve their accuracy and find their way around the keyboard without having to look down at it.</p>
<p>They also use these keycap profiles because it is very standard and commonly found on most keyboards. This means if they ever have to use someone else&#39;s keyboard or get a replacement, it is super easy to start typing at very high speeds comfortably.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to keycap profiles such as the ones on a low profile or laptop keyboard that has a very un-sculpted surface, which makes it easy to get lost on the keyboard and accidentally click in between keys.</p>
<h5>Layout</h5>
<p>Almost all of the top typists use the qwerty keyboard layout. Even though it is not technically the most ergonomic or has the highest potential for speed (like Dvorak), it is the standard. This means that you learn to type and have years of indirect practice using qwerty; which gives it the muscle memory advantage over alternative keyboard layouts.</p>
<p>They also use a standard staggered keyboard rather than an ortholinear or split keyboard because of the muscle memory that you develop when using the same keyboard layout for years.</p>
<h3>Why you should never use a low profile keyboard</h3>
<p> Another thing that I notice about the top typists is, that they use a regular mechanical keyboard rather than a low profile keyboard. This is contradictory to what most people think, that the shorter and thinner the keys are, the faster you can type.</p>
<p>A standard mx switch enables you to type faster because of the feedback, force curve, accuracy and travel distance, consistency, and performance. </p>
<p><strong>Feedback:</strong><br>A low profile switch doesn&#39;t offer as much feedback as a higher profile switch, this clarity helps the typist maintain rhythm at speed and reduces hesitations and accidental keypresses.</p>
<p><strong>Force Curve:</strong><br>More travel distance provides cushioning, which allows the typist to not have to bottom out every keypress (like on a low profile keyboard) and will allow them to move to the next key quicker with less fatigue.</p>
<p>Also the actuation force is spread over the entire keypress which makes it feel lighter and less abrupt, compared to clicking a low profile switch of the same actuation force.</p>
<p><strong>Accuracy:</strong><br> Also, the more sculpted keycaps of higher profile switches provide a lot more feedback and help a typist feel where each key is while touch typing much easier compared to a low profile switch with much flatter keycaps.</p>
<p><strong>Durability &amp;Consistency:</strong><br>Mechanical switches are designed for millions of presses with a stable feel, while many of the low profile switches degrade much faster, or become even or loose after a lot of typing. This makes typing much more consistent and reliable when using a keyboard with standard mx style switches.</p>
<p><strong>Performance:</strong><br>Many of the low profile keyboards do not support performance features such as, N-key rollover or tunable switches. This makes standard mechanical keyboards have the advantage, with different spring weights, lubes, and different stems. This makes each key more reliable and customizable compared to the limited low profile mechanical or scissor switches.</p>
<h3>Ending</h3>
<p>Because of everything above I recommend that you get a keyboard that has standard OEM keycaps, clicky or tactile switches, and to avoid linear or low profile keyboards. This doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t type fast on a keyboard with linear switches, or a low profile keyboard. It just means in order to push the limits of typing you might need a slightly different keyboard.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this blog, I had a lot of fun making it; got a new keyboard (razor huntsman mini); did a lot of research; and typing!</p>
